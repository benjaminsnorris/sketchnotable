The first event of day two at WWDC was what felt like an intimate conversation between Michelle Obama and Lisa Jackson. Much of the discussion focused around influence and how we as developers and entrepreneurs can learn from Obamaâ€™s life and example. She and her family have done a lot, even since leaving the office, and all of us are positioned to make a difference in the world as well.
