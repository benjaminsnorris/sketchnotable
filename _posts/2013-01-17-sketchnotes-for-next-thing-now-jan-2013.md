This was an exciting week! <a title="Tom Nagle" href="https://twitter.com/tomnagle" target="_blank">Tom Nagle</a> contacted me early in the week wanting me to do some sketchnotes for a great speaker series he has organized. <a title="Next Thing Now" href="http://www.nextthingnow.co/" target="_blank">Next Thing Now</a> served as the first stop for Dan Pink's book tour for his new title, <a title="To Sell Is Human" href="http://www.danpink.com/books/to-sell-is-human" target="_blank"><em>To Sell Is Human</em></a>.

It was such a treat to be able to get an exclusive look at Dan describing some of the principles from a book that I had on pre-order! His talk was an hour, and just scratched the surface of what is in the book. I hope you will enjoy the sketchnotes and then read the whole book. It will be well worth your time.
