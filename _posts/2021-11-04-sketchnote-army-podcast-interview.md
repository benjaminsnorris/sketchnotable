I was interviewed recently for the [Sketchnote Army podcast](https://sketchnotearmy.com/blog/2021/11/1/ben-norris):

> In this episode I talk with Ben Norris, a software developer, sketchnoter, mental health advocate, blacksmith, a loving husband and father of 7.
> 
> Ben shares his passion for mental health, and how sketchnoting is a meditative practice heâ€™s used to support his own journey with ideas for you too.
> 
> Journey along with us on this thoughtful discussion.
