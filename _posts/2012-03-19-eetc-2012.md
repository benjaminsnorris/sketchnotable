March 2012 marked the second annual Early Education and Technology for Children (EETC) Conference put on by the Waterford Institute. Since I work for Waterford, I had the opportunity to attend the conference. It was a fantastic gathering of people who were focused on how to improve the education and lives of children through the use of technology. I captured each of the keynote and featured speakers in sketchnotes and wanted to make them available. I look forward to a great conference again next year!
