One of my co-workers shared an opportunity to participate in a webinar sponsored by <a href="http://www.aipmm.com/" target="_blank">AIPMM</a> about UX design and Product Management. This defines the hybrid that is my life right now, so I was immediately intrigued. Brian Lawley from <a href="http://www.280group.com/" target="_blank">280 Group</a> and Mary Piontkowski from <a href="http://www.macadamian.com/" target="_blank">Macadamian</a> presented on integrating user experience design into the product lifecycle. It was a fantastic look at how good UX practices can transform products and companies. Naturally, I sketchnoted the event!
