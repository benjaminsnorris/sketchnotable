One good thing leads to another! A couple weeks ago, I <a href="https://bennorris.com/2013/01/17/sketchnotes-for-next-thing-now-jan-2013/" title="Sketchnotes for Next Thing Now JanÂ 2013">posted</a> about <a href="http://www.nextthingnow.co/" title="Next Thing Now" target="_blank">Next Thing Now</a> and some sketchnotes that I did for a webinar they put on. Through that event, I was introduced to John Meyer from The Company Corporation (<a href="http://www.incorporate.com" title="The Company Corporation">Incorporate.com</a>), who commissioned me to provide sketchnotes for a few webinars. They provide many of these webinars as free resources to small business owners in their <a href="https://www.incorporate.com/learning_center.html" title="Incorporate.com Learning Center" target="_blank">Learning Center</a>.

This first session was presented together with SCORE (<a href="http://www.score.org" title="Score Website">www.score.org</a>), and was all about how to start your own business. They went through the details of the preparation that you have to do, the options that you have, and the information that you need to know. It was a great session, and one that I would recommend to anyone who owns a small business or is looking to start one. Here are my sketchnotes!
