I am a nerd. I take notes in a <a title="Star Wars Moleskine for sketchnotes" href="http://www.moleskineus.com/star-wars-limited-edition-notebooks.html" target="_blank">Star Wars Moleskine notebook</a> and can't wait for the <a title="Lego Moleskine for sketchnotes" href="http://www.moleskineus.com/moleskine-lego-limited-edition.html" target="_blank">Lego Moleskines</a> to come out. I also have a decent collection of gadgetsâ€”I currently use an iPhone, an iPad, a Macbook Air, a Macbook Pro and an iMac. So a national Digital Learning Day is a great thing in my eyes. My department at work all tuned in for the broadcast of the national town hall.

The event was hosted by former West Virginia governor, Bob Wise, and began with a short discussion featuring Arnie Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education, and Julius Genachowski, FCC Chairman, and then moved to Skype calls with schools around the country. It was a feel-good celebration of current efforts at the high school level to integrate technology more into the school day. However, our company is focused on early education, and there was nothing discussed for the elementary school level, so we skipped the last half hour. Overall, I wholeheartedly support this event and hope that this movement of incorporating effective technology into our school system continues to gain momentum.

Here are my sketchnotes of the event.
